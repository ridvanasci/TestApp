/* I think I've finally got a complete understanding of how this works.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code takes the game list and reflects it on the page:

Application Startup: When you start the application, the SampleDataGenerator class is instantiated and the @PostConstruct method is called. This method generates 100 sample games and loads them into the H2 database.
Vaadin UI Creation: The Vaadin UI is created, and the GameView class is instantiated. This class is responsible for displaying the game list.
Game List Retrieval: The GameView class retrieves the game list from the H2 database using the SampleDataGenerator class.
Grid Component Creation: A Grid component is created in the GameView class to display the game list.
Game List Binding: The game list is bound to the Grid component using the Grid component's setItems method.
Grid Component Rendering: The Grid component is rendered on the page, displaying the game list with descriptions.
Delete and Edit Functionality: When you delete or edit a game, the corresponding action is performed on the H2 database using the SampleDataGenerator class.
Grid Component Update: The Grid component is updated to reflect the changes made to the game list.
The code uses a combination of Vaadin, Spring Boot, and H2 to achieve this functionality. The SampleDataGenerator class is responsible for generating the sample data and loading it into the H2 database, while the GameView class is responsible for displaying the game list and handling user interactions.

I hope this explanation helps clarify how the code works! */
